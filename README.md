# Projects completed during year 2020-2021 for Artificial Intelligence class

## Labyrinth
**Task**: 
- Create realistic looking labyrinths using Prim's algorithm with a start and an end
- Solve the labyrinths with Best first, BFS and A* algorithms

## Movie recommendation system
**Task**:
- Using python-prolog interoperability create read in a film database and define some predicates to categorize them
- Test various levels of similarity between movies using the above predicates
- Suggest movies using above model and test model effectiveness

## Hand-writing recognition
**Task**
- Complete prediction model evaluator implementation
- First try with a simple KNN model
- Then try with a Naive Bayes model (with proper assumptions)
- Finally implementing a multi-layer perceptron

*note:* Substantial parts of many of the provided implementations where provided semi-completed, but freedom of operation was given.
